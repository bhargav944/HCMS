    ---------------------------------------
    <string name="exe1">Exercises</string>
    <string name="exe2">1. Supine Hanstring Stretch</string>
    <string name="exe3">Lying on your back, bend your right knee into your chest and place a strap or rolled-up towel around the ball of your foot. Straighten your leg toward the ceiling. Press out through both heels. If the lower back feels strained, bend the left knee and place the foot on the ground. Hold for 3-5 minutes and then switch to the left let for 3-5 minutes.</string>
    <string name="exe4">2. Two-Knee Twist</string>
    <string name="exe5">Lying on your back, bend your knees into your chest and bring your arms out at a T. As you exhale lower your knees to ground on the right. Keep both shoulders pressing down firmly. If the left shoulder lifts, lower your knees further away from the right arm. Hold for 1-2 minutes each side.</string>
    <string name="exe6">3. Thread the Needle</string>
    <string name="exe7">Lying on your back, bend both knees with the feet flat on the ground. Bend the right knee like a figure four, with the outer left ankle to the right thigh. Lift the left foot into the air, bringing the left calf parallel to the ground. Thread your right hand between the opening of the legs and interlace your hands behind your left thigh. Hold 2-3 minutes and then repeat on the other side.</string>
    <string name="exe8">4. Bottom to heels stretch</string>
    <string name="exe9">Stretches and mobilises the spine</string>
    <string name="exe10">Start position: Kneel on all fours, with your knees under hips and hands under shoulders. Don\'t over-arch your lower back. Keep your neck long, your shoulders back and don\'t lock your elbows. </string>
    <string name="exe11">Action: Slowly take your bottom backwards, maintaining the natural curve in the spine. Hold the stretch for one deep breath and return to the starting position. Repeat 8 to 10 times. </string>
    <string name="exe12">Tips: Avoid sitting back on your heels if you have a knee problem. Ensure correct positioning with the help of a mirror. Only stretch as far as feels comfortable.</string>
    <string name="exe13">Legs Up the Wall</string>
    <string name="exe14">Scoot your buttocks all the way into the wall and swing your feet up the wall. This pose is excellent for relaxing the muscles of the lower back and drains stagnant fluid from the feet and ankles. Do this pose after a challenging workout and always after traveling by plane. Hold for 5-10 minutes</string>
    <string name="res1">Rest</string>
    <string name="res2">Ceasing activity for a few days allows injured tissue and even nerve roots to begin to heal, which in turn will help relieve lower back pain. However, more than a few days of rest can lead to a weakening of the muscles, and weak muscles have to struggle to adequately support the spine. People who do not regularly exercise to build strength and flexibility are more likely to experience recurrent or prolonged lower back pain.</string>
    <string name="hip1">Heat and Ice Packs</string>
    <string name="hip2">Heat and/or cold therapy helps relieve most types of low back pain by reducing inflammation. Often people use ice, but some prefer heat. Both may be used alternately.</string>
    <string name="mgp1">Maintain Good Posture</string>
    <string name="mgp2">The pain may have started after a long workout at the gym, but the strain that caused it has probably been building for years. Wilmarth says most people have poor posture when going about their daily activities, putting unnecessary strain on their backs. "Little things add up," she says. "You can increase the pressure on your back by 50% simply by leaning over the sink incorrectly to brush your teeth. Keeping the right amount of curvature in the back takes pressure off the nerves and will reduce back pain."</string>
    <string name="rsr1">Rub in some relief</string>
    <string name="rsr2">Ask a partner to massage the aching area . If you want to use a "back rub" cream or ointment, go ahead , but use caution , as most topical creams produce skin irritation after a few applications. For a simple back -massage aid , stuff several tennis balls into a long sock, tie the end of the sock , and have your partner roll it over your back .</string>
    ------------------------------------------
    <string name="mas1">Massage</string>
    <string name="mas2">Massage therapy helps relieve joint pain by improving circulation and soothing inflammation. In fact, several studies indicate that regular massage can improve pain, stiffness and range of motion in the affected joint. To massage the affected area, use warm oil like coconut, olive, mustard, castor or garlic oil and apply gentle pressure while massaging.</string>
    <string name="hcc1">Heat and Cold Compresses</string>
    <string name="hcc2">Alternating hot and cold compresses can also help ease joint pain. Heat therapy helps decrease pain, increase blood flow and relax sore muscles and joints. Cold therapy reduces inflammation and numbs the areas around the affected joint.</string>
    <string name="hcc3">1.Wrap both compresses in separate towels before using them. They should not be applied directly to the skin.\n\n2.Place the hot compress on the affected area for about three minutes.\n\n3.Remove the compress and immediately put a cold compress in its place for about one minute.\n\n4.Repeat the process for 15 to 20 minutes a few times daily until you get relief.</string>
    <string name="hcc4">Do not use heat therapy if the affected area is red, hot and irritated. Do not use cold therapy if you have circulatory problems.</string>
    <string name="trm1">Turmeric</string>
    <string name="trm2">Turmeric is an excellent Ayurvedic remedy for joint pain. It contains an active ingredient called curcumin with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Mix one teaspoon of turmeric powder and a little honey in a glass of warm milk. Drink it daily, at least for a few days. Another option is to take 250 to 500 mg turmeric capsules three times daily until you are satisfied with the results.</string>
    <string name="dmw1">Drink more Water</string>
    <string name="dmw2">Among the lesser-known benefits of drinking more water is that it softens cartilage and keeps it hydrated. Water helps you maintain an adequate blood volume so that nutrients can move through your blood and into your joints. It also moves waste away from your joints, making them less likely to ache.</string>
    <string name="acv1" translatable="false">Apple Cider Vinegar</string>
    <string name="acv2" translatable="false">Apple cider vinegar helps reduce joint pain by eliminating accumulated toxins from the joints and connective tissues. Due to its alkalizing effect, it is particularly beneficial for those suffering from arthritis. Plus, it is rich in minerals like magnesium, calcium, potassium and phosphorus.</string>
    <string name="acv3" translatable="false">Mix one to three teaspoons of organic apple cider vinegar and a little honey in a cup of warm water. Drink this solution two or three times a day, preferably before meals. You can continue this simple treatment on a regular basis because, in addition to helping with joint pain, it is good for your overall health.</string>
    ------------------------------------
    Sun Burn
    <string name="pop1">Potato paste</string>
    <string name="pop2">If you\'ve found yourself with searing hot red skin, root up a few potatoes. Potatoes have been known as a pain reliever throughout the years, working particularly well on minor skin irritations and soothing scratches, bites, and burns, as well as possibly reducing inflammation. Some people feel that the juice of the potato works the best, while others feel just slices are sufficient. Try both, and see which one is the best remedy for your sunburn.</string>
    <string name="pop3">You will need:</string>
    <string name="pop4">2 potatoes\nA grater, blender, or knife\nCotton balls, cotton pads, facial tissue, or gauze</string>
    <string name="pop5">Directions</string>
    <string name="pop6">Wash and scrub your potatoes thoroughly, and then either grate them over a bowl or cut them up and put them in a blender. There is no need to remove the peels. If you\'re using a blender, give them a whirl until they\'ve become quite liquid. If they seem too dry, you can add a small amount of water. Pour out the mixture, soak cotton balls thoroughly in it, and apply to sunburn. An easier perhaps more effective method would be to soak gauze and lay it over the burn. If you\'re using a grater, grate the potatoes over a bowl and apply the pulp, trying to get as much juice as possible. You can also try simply slicing the potatoes, and lying the slices directly on your burn.</string>
    <string name="dru1">Drink Up</string>
    <string name="dru2">Sunburn is a burn. It sounds like stating the obvious, but we often don\'t think about the fact that we really, truly, seared our skin. As with any other thing that burns your skin is dried out, and your body is probably dehydrated too. Keep a tall glass or bottle of ice cold water on hand at all times to make sure you\'re keeping yourself full of H20, which is necessary to heal your damaged skin</string>
    <string name="cmt1">Cool off with Mint Tea</string>
    <string name="cmt2">Mint naturally cools and soothes whatever it touches, and sunburns are no exception. The tannic acid and theobromine found in green tea also helps relieve pain and heal damaged skin when applied topically.</string>
    <string name="cmt3">You will need:</string>
    <string name="cmt4">1 quart of boiling water\n5 green tea bags\n3 cups of fresh mint leaves\nCotton pads or a clean soft cloth</string>
    <string name="cmt5">Directions</string>
    <string name="cmt6">Bring 1 quart of water to a boil. Remove the strings and tags from the 5 tea bags and add them, as well as 3 cups of fresh mint leaves, to a pan. Pour the boiling water over the mint leaves and tea bags and cover with a lid, letting it sit for approximately an hour so you can get all the good stuff out of it. Strain and then chill. When the mixture has chilled thoroughly, use cotton pads or a clean soft cloth soaked in the liquid and apply directly to the burn. You can also pour it over the burn if you wish. If you find yourself without green tea you can substitute black tea, which also contains tannins.</string>
    <string name="isa1">Indulge in some aloe</string>
    <string name="isa2">Aloe vera gel is many peoples go-to when they have sunburn. It\'s cool, soothing, and seems to suck the sting and redness right out of your sunburn. Because aloe is useful for a number of other ailments (such as acne or heartburn) it\'s handy to have a plant growing in your house. They\'re easy to maintain, free from any additives, and you won\'t have to keep running out to buy more from the store all the time once it\'s big enough. If you would really rather prefer not having the plant, getting some good quality aloe vera gel from the store is the next best thing-it\'s also more practical for treating larger areas.</string>
    <string name="isa3">You will need:</string>
    <string name="isa4">An aloe plant with thick, juicy, leaves\nEnough store bought gel to cover your burn</string>
    <string name="isa5">If using the plant, slit several big leaves down the middle, not cutting all the way through. Spread them flat, and lay on your burn. You can also squeeze the gel out. If you\'re using gel that\'s already been extracted, apply however much you need to your sunburn. The plant is usually more practical when treating smaller areas, while the purchased aloe gel is easier to spread over a big burn. A combination of both works as well.</string>
    <string name="upy1">Use plain Yogurt</string>
    <string name="upy2">Live cultured plain yogurt contains an abundance of probiotics and enzymes that help heal our skin. When you find yourself red and sunburned, it can help you recover faster. Make sure it\'s truly plain yogurt, not vanilla, and that it has probiotics.</string>
    <string name="upy3">You will need:</string>
    <string name="upy4">1/2 cup or so of plain live cultured yogurt</string>
    <string name="upy5">A half cup of plain yogurt should be sufficient to treat facial burns at least, but feel free to use more if you want to cover more area. Wash your hands and apply cool yogurt directly to your burn, and let it sit for at least 5 minutes. When the pain has subsided, gently rinse it off with cool or tepid water.</string>
